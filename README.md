# deck-of-cards

This coding challenge was given to me by a friend.

Criteria:
  1. Generate a full deck of cards that can be interacted with;
  2. Ability to select cards from the pack. Those cards would appear in your hand and dissapear from the deck;
  3. Ability to shuffle the hand and the deck;
  4. Ability to order the hand and the deck by suit (club, spade, heart, diamond) then by face value;

I added a Draw Seven button which draws the first seven cards in the deck, and a reset button.

Happy tinkering!
